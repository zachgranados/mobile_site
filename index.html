Riley can be pretty mischievous; as such, his favorite activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on a cool floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk in his local park or hang out with his best friend Cosmo.</p>
    
    <p class = "paragraph"> Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and pampered. He is currently in his “terrible twos,” and must get everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a perfect, funny, and loyal dog. </p>

                <p> Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he is not causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.</p>
    
                <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

                <p>He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around, scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too. Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.</p>

                <p>Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his bone or tennis ball. He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are kibble and peanut butter. Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
    
                <p>
                    My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old and is now 8 years old. Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however, he quickly recovered and has been doing great since.
